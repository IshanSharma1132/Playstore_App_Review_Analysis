# Playstore_App_Review_Analysis
Google play store is one of the largest and most popular Android app stores. Google play store,also branded as the Google play and formerly Android Market, is a digital distribution service operated and developed by Google.It was launched on March 6,2012.Play store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success and most popular operating system in the world, with over 3 billion active users spanning over 190 countries with million apps.
In this EDA project we  have two data sets one is play store reviews and other is user reviews. The first dataset contains 13 attributes and the other contains 5,it is used for data manipulation and its analysis.The first and important step for EDA is data cleaning for that we dropped all duplicate null values from attributes. We have lots of null values. It is not possible to drop all null values. So, we replaced it with Mode of ratings.
After dropping all null and duplicate values, we adjust all the columns into the required format. So we visualize data easily, with the help of cleaned data we have performed EDA to understand our dataset like the number of paid or free apps. Explore the app pricing trend across popular categories and so on.
After analysis we find correlation between data frames.
